# WordNet
Created a program using symbol tables and direct graph as the underlying data structure to find out the odd word out of the given words.  
This project is related to my Algorithms and Data Structure course at UMB. 
This project has additional exercises - GraphProperties and DiGraphProperties. 
While the other three java programs are built to accomplish the main goal of the project, which is to find out the odd word out of the sevral given words. 
I have attached the report as well which in detail explains what the program does. 
This project is adapeted from the Princeton creative assinment website.
